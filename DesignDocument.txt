#Design Questions
- What are the rules to the game?
- How are the player pieces visually identified?
- What other elements are in the game?
- What input from the user would you need to make the game go?

The game has a minimum of two players with no maximum. 
A score.csv file will store the player, turn, and position on the board. 
The player will roll a pair of dice at the beginning of their turn. Before they roll they must guess if the dice total will be odd or even. 
If the player's guess is correct, they move forward the number of spots rolled on the die. 
The score.csv file is then updated for their position to be the previous position plus the number on the dice roll. 
If the player's guess is incorrect, they skip their turn. 
There are a total of 100 spaces on the board, the first player to reach or exceed 100 spaces wins. 
If the game is left, score.csv file will retain the player, turn and position. 
When the app is opened each time, the game will ask if the players from the score.csv file would like to continue their game. 
The player can choose to continue with their last game or to start a new game. 
With each new game, the user must input player names for who is playing. Inputing the names will write to the csv file so that each name entered starts with a turn of 0 and position of 0.
For each turn, the Player name will display and the player can select dice to roll. 
The player will be displayed on a numbered, grid. Each player will be a labeled dot. 
The board will be a rainbow of colors. 
Multiple pieces can reside in the same spot as each turn and position is stored in the csv relative to the individual player.
